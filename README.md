## üìå Problem Statement

The company experienced frequent issues with **uncollected payments, delayed cash inflows, and difficulties reconciling customer balances**, due to the absence of a structured system to monitor incoming payments. This led to **increased outstanding receivables**, reduced working capital, and limited visibility into which customers had overdue accounts.

To solve this, a **Customer Payment Tracking Sheet** was introduced to help the company **monitor invoices, track payment statuses, and follow up with customers efficiently**, ensuring better cash flow management and improved customer accountability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

The primary tool used for this project was **Google Sheets**.

- **Drop-down menus** for customer names and payment terms.
- **Conditional formatting** to highlight overdue invoices and outstanding balances
- **Data validation** to minimize input errors
- **Auto-calculated columns** for price,due date of payment, paymment status.

Google Sheets also allowed for seamless **sharing with team members** and exporting to other formats like Excel or PDF when needed. It proved especially useful for maintaining visibility and accountability in customer payment follow-ups.
